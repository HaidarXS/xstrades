        <br/><br/>
        Introduction to Futures
        <br/>
        Trading Futures trading involves standardized contracts binding parties to buy or sell assets at set prices on future dates. These assets range from commodities like gold or oil to financial instruments like stock indices or currencies. Futures trading is integral to commodity futures, precious metal futures, and other futures markets.
        <br/><br/>
        Reasons to Trade Futures
        <br/>
        Futures contracts serve two primary purposes: speculation and hedging. Speculators use them to predict future asset prices, while hedgers lock in future asset prices, benefiting businesses like farmers selling crops or airlines purchasing fuel.
        <br/><br/>
        What To Consider Before You Trade Futures
        <br/>
        Trading futures involves managing leverage and margin, enabling control over more significant positions with reduced capital while emphasizing prudent risk management. These markets offer access to global platforms with diverse asset classes, catering to speculators and hedgers. Diving into futures markets demands understanding volatility, liquidity, and the role of risk mitigation strategies. Incorporating futures in investment portfolios can enhance diversification, given their low correlation with traditional assets.
